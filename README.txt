This repository contains the w vectors (moral principle vectors) generated for the tests run in 'Modeling of Moral Decisions with Deep Learning'.
- All data are stored as .mat files.
- w_samples directory contains two subdirectories: the 'abstract_situation' folder contains data used in the testing of a generalized, abstract scenario. 'autonomous_vechicle' holds data used specifically for the autonomous vehicle scenario.
- 'test_sets' directories contain data used for model testing. 'training_sets' directories contain data used to train a deep neural network.
- Each .mat file has a number in the filename, which indicates the average absolute magnitude of the 'k' values of the underlying distribution.
